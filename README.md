### Install

The program is written in java >1.8 [download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (required).
In order to load real in-game images you need python [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)  (optional) and install oyaml and maybe unitypack.
In a commandline or terminal:
```
$ pip install oyaml
$ pip install unitypack
```
(maybe add '--user' for non global install)


~~To run it just download the zip from the 'clone or download'-button on Github.
start.bat runs the jar from build/TUR.jar. (linux/mac can run the same command as in start.bat from a commandline or create a script)~~
The download is now in the [release tab](https://github.com/APN-Pucky/TUR/releases) (<- download TUR.zip from here).

### Notes
There is still a lot of debug prints, but maybe I'll remove them in later versions.

The interface ist (hopefully) pretty straigth forward.
You can of course report bugs/ideas here and they might get fixed/added at some point.
